/**
 * Q-Rix Core Status Script
 * =======================
 * 
 * DESCRIPTION:
 * This script checks and displays the status of the Q-Rix core in the Aixtiv Symphony system.
 * The Q-Rix core is an advanced intelligence framework that combines multiple agent capabilities
 * from the Squadron agents (Lucy, Grant, Burby, Sabina) to create a unified intelligence system.
 * 
 * Q-Rix (Quantum Revolutionary Intelligence Nexus) represents an upgrade from standard RIX agents,
 * combining specific squadron agent instances to form a more powerful, cohesive intelligence unit.
 * 
 * USAGE:
 * node qrix_status.js
 * 
 * INFORMATION DISPLAYED:
 * - Lucy Nodes status (01: Memory, 02: Prediction, 03: Trace)
 * - Grant 02: Security and Deployment Grid status
 * - Burby 01: S2DO Enforcement Core status
 * - Sabina 03: Vision Vector and Engagement Pulse status
 * - Q-Rix core lattice state
 * - RIX Command Core 6 status
 * - Orchestration trace status
 * - Last activation timestamp
 * - Uptime information
 * - Active missions count
 * - Available capacity percentage
 * 
 * FUTURE INTEGRATION:
 * This standalone script will eventually be integrated into the Aixtiv CLI system
 * as a proper command (aixtiv qrix:status) along with related commands for
 * deploying Q-Rix agents and analyzing their temporal coherence.
