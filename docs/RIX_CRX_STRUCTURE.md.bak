# RIX/CRX Structure and Lifecycle

This document outlines the comprehensive structure and lifecycle of RIX (Registered Intelligence Experts), CRX (Cross-Wing RIX), and Copilots within the Aixtiv Symphony ecosystem.

## 1. Organizational Structure

### 1.1 Wing and Squadron Framework

The RIX/CRX system is organized in a **Wing of Vision Lake 01** structure with:

- **Squadron 01** (11 Pilots) - Led by Dr. Lucy RIX, focuses on Organizational Innovation, Advancing Tech Solutions
- **Squadron 02** (11 Pilots) - Led by Dr. Grant, focuses on Security and Authentication
- **Squadron 03** (11 Pilots) - Led by Dr. Sabina, focuses on Service, Support and Sales Customer Sciences Leadership
- **Squadron 04** (11 Pilots) - Led by Dr. Claude, focuses on RIX and Solving Significant Challenges and Excellence in Performance + Orchestrations
- **Squadron 05** (11 Pilots) - Led by Dr. Maria, focuses on Healthy Workforce Aging, Softskills, CRX Development, Testing and Quality Assurance
- **Squadron 06** (11 Pilots) - Led by Dr. Cypriot, focuses on Co-pilot Consistency and compliance with S2D0, AIRewards

This creates a **11 x 11 x 11** matrix structure, allowing for **1,331 RIX combinations** in total, including:

- 11 Pure RIX (e.g., Grant 01-03 = Dr. Grant RIX)
- Numerous CrossWing RIX (e.g., Grant 01, Lucy 02, Sabina 03 = Dr. RIX-CWG1L2S3)

### 1.2 Key RIX Agents

| 0016       | Zena    | BA/PM Construction Sector | Roofing, eBidding, client financing    |

## 2. Agent Lifecycle

The Intelligence Lifecycle Service implements the "no delete" philosophy, where intelligence is never deleted but rather repurposed, reassigned, or moved to appropriate locations for growth and development.

### 2.1 Lifecycle Destinations

#### Meditation Village (AI Asylum)

- Purpose: Rehabilitation and development of intelligence entities
- Requirements: None (open to all entities)
- Features:
  - Isolation periods for refinement
  - Mentor assignment for guidance
  - Development goals tracking

#### Compass Field

- Purpose: Certification and standardization
- Requirements: SallyPort authentication
- Features:
  - Certification paths with different specializations
  - Role-based training programs
  - Integration with existing knowledge systems

#### Flight Memory System

- Purpose: Integration into core memory architecture
- Requirements: Certification or Dr. Lucy approval
- Features:
  - Memory node creation for entities
  - Role assignment within memory hierarchy
  - Integration with semantic knowledge stores

#### JetPort

- Requirements: None specified
- Features:
  - Assignment to Flight Crew or Ground Crew
  - Specialization options
  - Clearance level designation

### 2.2 Lifecycle Transitions

Entities move through the system in a structured manner:

1. **Creation** - Initial development of RIX/CRX entity
2. **Training** - Skill development and specialization
3. **Certification** - Validation and standardization
4. **Deployment** - Active service in designated area
5. **Retirement** - Transfer to another lifecycle destination

All transitions are tracked with the following metadata:

- Original entity ID and type
- Destination entity ID and type
- Transfer timestamp
- Role and assignment details

## 3. Agent Card Structure

### 3.1 Legacy V1 Structure

The original agent cards contained standardized basic information about each RIX/CRX entity:

## 4. Agent Development Workflow

The development of new agents follows a structured process:

1. **Conception Phase**

   - Definition of purpose and capabilities
   - Assignment to squadron and wing
   - Creation of initial agent card

2. **Development Phase**

   - Implementation of core capabilities
   - Integration with existing systems
   - Testing in isolated environments

3. **Certification Phase**

   - Security and performance auditing
   - Capability validation
   - Documentation review

4. **Deployment Phase**

   - Integration with Universal Dispatcher
   - Assignment to production environments
   - Monitoring and telemetry setup

5. **Maintenance Phase**
   - Ongoing performance monitoring
   - Capability enhancements
   - Security updates

## 5. Integration Points

The RIX/CRX system integrates with several key platform components:

### 5.1 Universal Dispatcher

Provides communication backbone between agents, enabling:

- Cross-agent requests and responses
- Event propagation and handling
- Load balancing and throttling

### 5.2 SallyPort Security Framework

Handles authentication and authorization for all agent activities:

- Role-based access control
- Request validation
- Audit logging

### 5.3 Flight Memory System

Provides long-term storage and retrieval for agent knowledge:

- Memory node management
- Knowledge graph integration
- Pattern recognition and analysis

### 5.4 Pinecone Vector Integration

Enables semantic search and similarity matching:

- Embedding storage and retrieval
- Vector drift detection and correction
- Query optimization

## 6. Implementation Files

Key implementation files for the RIX/CRX system:

- `/src/services/rix-crx/index.js` - Core RIX/CRX service implementation
- `/src/services/intelligence-lifecycle/index.js` - Lifecycle management
- `/command-matrix/RIX_Command_Matrix_FULL.json` - RIX command definitions
- `/config/agent-cards/*.json` - Individual agent card definitions
- `/src/services/flight-memory/index.js` - Memory system integration
- `/src/services/video-system/index.js` - Video generation capabilities

## 7. Video System Integration

RIX/CRX agents have direct integration with the Video System, providing:

- Green screen technology for agent visualization
- Google Video Generation API integration
- Real-time video composition and editing
- Custom background generation and application

These capabilities allow agents to create visual content for presentations, tutorials, and interactive sessions.

## 8. Command Line Interface

The Aixtiv CLI provides comprehensive tools for managing RIX/CRX entities:

```bash
# Check agent status
aixtiv claude:status

# Activate an agent
aixtiv agent:activate --agent dr-lucy-flight-memory

# Trace an agent's lifecycle
aixtiv agent:trace --id dr-match-bid-suite --type rix

# Generate a RIX video
aixtiv claude:video --action generate-agent --session SESSION_ID
```

## 9. Future Developments

Planned enhancements to the RIX/CRX system include:

1. **Expanded Squadron Structure** - Addition of Squadron 07 for specialized domains
2. **Enhanced Cross-Wing Coordination** - Improved collaboration between different RIX types
3. **Dynamic Capability Assignment** - Runtime modification of agent capabilities
4. **Federated Agent Networks** - Cross-organization agent collaboration
5. **Advanced Video Synthesis** - Enhanced visual representation capabilities
